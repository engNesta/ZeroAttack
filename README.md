### Machine Learning Model for Network Packet Classification

We are building a machine learning model to classify **network packets** (or network events) as either **normal** or **suspicious**. These network packets are essentially data flows, like messages or connections, passing through a network.

#### Network Packets and System Checks

1. **Network Packets**:
   - A **network packet** is a unit of data that travels across the network. When you send an email, browse a webpage, or stream a video, your data is broken into packets that travel over the internet.
   - Each packet contains a **header** (with information like source/destination IP, protocol, etc.) and a **payload** (the actual data being transmitted).

2. **System Checks**:
   - In our scenario, **system checks** are the security mechanisms that evaluate incoming and outgoing network packets for signs of threats.
   - These checks are performed by **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** or **Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)**. These are like network security guards monitoring data traffic for malicious activities.
   - An **IDS** inspects packets and raises an alert if something suspicious is detected. It **does not block** traffic.
   - An **IPS** can **block** potentially harmful packets in real-time to prevent an attack.

#### Model's Role in IDS/IPS Workflow

Our machine learning model will be integrated into the **IDS/IPS workflow** to:
- **Analyze packets** based on features like `Protocol`, `Netflow Bytes`, `Flag`, etc.
- **Classify** each packet as:
  - **Normal**: The packet is safe and can continue its journey.
  - **Suspicious**: The packet is potentially harmful, requiring further action (such as raising an alert or blocking it).

#### Summary
- We are building a **classification model** that serves as a **decision-maker** within an intrusion detection system.
- The model will classify network packets as **normal or suspicious** based on historical data.

This helps **automate threat detection**, making network security more efficient and proactive. Instead of relying on manual checks, the model provides real-time classifications to assist in protecting the network.
